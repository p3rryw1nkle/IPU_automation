# IPU_automation

### Must have a 'spreadsheets' folder in the base directory and within that folder a 'completed' folder. In the 'completed' folder
### there should also be two folders, one called 'email' and one 'without_email'.

### There should also be a 'logs' directory to store the conflict.log, which contains information anomalies for each IPU

### At the bottom of writeSpreadsheet.py where it says "makeFiles.process_files(initials="LB")" you will need to put in your personal initials to process your individually assigned IPUs
