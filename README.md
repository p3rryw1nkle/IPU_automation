# IPU_automation

### Must have a 'spreadsheets' folder in the base directory and within that folder a 'completed' folder. In the 'completed' folder there should also be two folders, one called 'email' and one 'without_email'. 

### There should also be a 'logs' folder in the base directory to store the conflict.log, which contains information anomalies for each IPU

### At the bottom of writeSpreadsheet.py where it says "makeFiles.process_files(initials="LB")" you will need to put in your personal initials to process your individually assigned IPUs

### Also make sure to download and drag in the spreadsheet containing all license information into the 'spreadsheets' folder and rename it to "Licenses.xlsx". The program will look for this file to get the IPU information.

### You can delete the delete_me.txt files in the email & without_email fodlers inside spreadsheets/completed/
